                        <p>The privacy of our clients is our top priority and we respect it as our own. Even though we
                            collect information from our clients, it is only to make an improvement in our customer
                            services. Our company does recognize that the maintenance and use of our clients’
                            information is our responsibility. We DO NOT rent or sell the information that our client
                            provides to us online <br>

                            This policy describes how the personal information of our client collected by us is used,
                            why we collect it, and how we use it. It is within our policy that we describe the choices
                            you can make about how we can collect and use your information.</p>

                            prevent the user from receiving e-mail communications relating to any online order they

                        <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to the clients’ computer’s hard
                            drive through their Web browser. This enables our systems to recognize the clients’ browser
                            and storage of items in your Shopping Cart during visits. <br>
                            The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will be more helpful in explaining how to
                            prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the user when
                            a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you
                            to take full advantage of the top features at our site, and our company’s personal
                            recommendation is that the client leaves them to be accepted.</p>
